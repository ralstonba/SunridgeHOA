                        Covenants reflect the ideals and values of the Sunridge Community and safeguard the preservation of precious mountain resources that make Sunridge desireable for all owners. They form a pact and covenant between all Association members. In holding property at Sunridge, owners agree to abide by all rules, regulations and covenants, and to carefully observe that all family members and guests do the same. All Association emembers are called upon to honor this solemn responsibility.
                        <h5>RECITALS</h5>
                        A. The Association is the owner of those certain Parcels of Common Property which are part of the Sunridge development and which are not contained within the individually owned Lots.
                        B. The Association desires to provide for the preservation of values and amenities at Sunridge, the maintenance of the Common Area, and the promotion of the health, safety and social welfare of each owner. To this end and for the benefit of the Property and of the owners thereof, the Association subjects the Property and the Sunridge Property Owners to the provisions of these Covenants and to the covenants, restrictions, easements, charges and liens hereinafter set forth.
                        C.

For such purpose the Association has caused to be incorporated under the laws of the State of Utah, as a nonprofit corporation, The Sunridge Property Owners Association.
                        D. All former Covenants, conditions and restrictions are hereby repealed and are hereby replaced or superseded by this document, which establishes a uniform general plan for the protection and maintenance of Sunridge Properties. As of adoption, thses Covenants will uniformly apply to all of the combined subdivisions and individual Lots which are part of and comprise the Sunridge Property Owners Association.
                        NOW, THEREFORE, for the foregoing purposes, the Association hereby declares that all of the Property described in these Covenants is and shall be held, occupied, improved, transferred, sold, leased and conveyed subject to the following easements, restrictions, covenants and conditions, which shall run with the Property and be binding on all parties having any right, title, or interest in the property or any part thereof, their heirs, successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of each owner thereof.

Whenever a condition exists which may be in violation of these Covenants and restrictions , the Association shall provide written notice of the violation to the Property Owner by certified mail or personal delivery.
