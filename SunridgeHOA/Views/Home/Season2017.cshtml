        <h1>Toxic weeds in Sunridge: Jan, 2017</h1>
        <p>Myrtle Spurge (Donkey tail) has been spotted on Sunridge. Contact with this weed is very dangerous! If someone gets the milky substance on them it will cause 3rd degree burns, and if it gets into your eyes you could lose your eye sight. All parts of this plant are considered poisonous!</p>
        <p>The most common victims of myrtle spurge are children who unassumingly pick the pretty flowers!</p>
        <p>It is a perennial that produces new stems from taproot each year. The plants are 4 to 6 inches tall, have trailing stems, and fleshy, blue-green, triangle-shaped leaves. In the spirng they produce clusters of small yellow flowers on top of each stem.</p>

These links will open in their own page (or tab). If you have any trouble downloading or viewing the files, please contact me at webmaster@sunridge.info for assistance.</p>
