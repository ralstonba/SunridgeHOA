      <h1>ATV type Vehicles Identification Rules</h1>

<p class="sans">The ability to identify all riders has already been a real tool in helping
							us provide accountability, and reduce the number of non-Sunridge riders
							that had managed to get in from adjoining areas.<br>
              		<br>
              		ALL ATV TYPE VEHICLES MUST HAVE PLATES! We will deny access
              		to anyone that does not have properly identification plates (whether
              		on a transport trailer, or in use). If you plan to have a guest
              		in for a tour of Sunridge for an hour, or for a week end visit&#8230;.even
              		visitor ATV&#8217;s types vehicles must be tagged. If the security
              		guard is not there to remind you, you are not permitted to by-pass
              		this security rule. We have done all we can to resist having
              		to fine offending non-compliant riders, but we will not allow
              		any exceptions. If you have any questions to ask&#8230;do so.
              		But please be a part of the solution here with all your neighbors&#8230;not
              		a part of the problem. We&#8217;ve gone through a lot of effort
              		to make these available&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;please help us all
              		out, and use them&#8230;..or ride elsewhere. Thank you.</p>
