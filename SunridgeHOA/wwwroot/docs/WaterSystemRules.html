      <h1>Water Systme Rules</h1>

<p class="sans">It is important to remember
								that the Sunridge water system is one of the most important assets that
								we have and depend on throughout the years. The water system in Sunridge
								is owned and controlled by the Sunridge Property Owners and managed by
								the Board of Trustees. This means that we are responsible for maintaining
								the quality and safety of the water, so please help us by following the
								rules for connecting and developing your water system on your property.<br />
							
						<p class="sans" align="left">1. All connections to the water system must be pre-approved by the Sunridge Water Master and/or Borad Member.<br /><br />
									2. The actual connection work on main water lines must be performed by a Sunridge authorized contractor.<br /><br />
									
3. Sunridge Board of Trustees reserves the right to inspect any water system that is connected to the Sunridge water system for health and safety purposes.<br /><br />

4. Requirements
<ul>
<li>All piping must be blue poly &frac34;" IPS (Iron Pipe Size) or &frac34;" CPS (Copper Pipe Size).</li>
<li>All fittings must be brass and compression fittings (no street elbows, galvanized, hose clamps, and PVC).</li>
<li>Meter setters with backflow are required on new installations and upgrades.</li>
<li>If the stop and waster valve at the property line is replaced, it must be upgraded to the meter set.</li>
<li>If, as a property owner, you are replacing or modifying water lines or hydrants, they must be inspected by the Water Master (no charge for this inspection).</li>
</ul>

5. If unauthorized parts or non-inspected systems cause a water leak, you will be responsible for cost of repairs and subject to fines:
<ul>
<li>First offense, $500 fine.</li>
<li>Second offense, $1000 fine.</li>
</ul>

</p>
									<p class="sans">It is important to remember that protecting Sunridge and keeping it safe requires that we all follow the rules and work together for our	common goals. Thank you for your cooperation. We all value the quality	time we spend in Sunridge, and with your help we can continue to have a high quality water system that is safe for everyone.</p>
